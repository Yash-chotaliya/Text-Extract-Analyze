 machines replace humans 
 decades  sooner   notion work handled human virtual hinge predictability. starting today  machines manage routine humans unpredictable   tasks require creativity  problem solving  flexibility. context  robotics improve operations efficiency improve quality life workers.
 obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation  highly repetitive tasks mechanical ideal robots. greater efficiency  automation leads risk accidents  greater control autonomy   fewer costs organizations.
