How i approached solution ?

- i have created 4 python files:
    (a) extract articles from given urls in 'Input.xlsx'
    - i have used BeautifulSoup library for scraping the content of given urls
    - extracted content i have saved in 'URL_Content' folder

    (b) remove stopwords from extracted articles
    - remove stopwords given in 'StopWords' folder
    - save this cleaned content in 'Cleaned_URL_Content' folder

    (c) create dictionary
    - create dictionary of positive and negative words from 'MasterDictionary' folder words
    - saved this dictionary in 'Dictionary.json' file

    (d) analyze variables
    - analyze all variables given in 'Output Data Structure.xlsx' file
    - save this analyzed variable in 'Output Data Structure.xlsx' file itself

How to run the .py file to generate output :
    
    1. first create environment using following command :
        >> conda create -p "{path to the current directory}\venv"

    2. activate environment using following command :
        >> conda activate "{path to the current directory}\venv"

    3. install requirements.txt packages using following command:
        >> pip install -r requirements.txt

    4. run main.py file using following command:
        >> python main.py

I have included all dependencies in requirements.py

Note :- In the 'Output Data Structure.xlsx' file, I have blanked the rows where the article is removed or not found at the URL.
